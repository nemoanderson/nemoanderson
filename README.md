## Hi there 👋🏽
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a real estate landing page for inbound sellers of off-market properties to assign to buyers of property.  Built with HTML & CSS with a form that sends an email to me when filled out. The buyer landing page is being developed as well and I add as I learn. Also some more projects as a weather app, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript. Just some refresh on important CSS like flex and grid.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting a paid job.
